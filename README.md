Mental disorders are a major problem of public health, they concern the patients but also their entourage, it is a major problem because their care is very problematic
in low-income countries, 76% to 85% of people with mental disorders are not supported for this condition. In high-income countries, 35% to 50% of those affected are in the same situation. These figures are consistent with the lack of mental health professionals.
Another problem concerns people under treatment; Indeed, the poor quality of care provided to these patients is another problem that aggravates the situation. This state of affairs is related on the one hand to the difficulty of the correct diagnosis and the determination of its gravity which has a direct impact on the therapeutic strategy to follow. On the other hand for the same diagnosis, different treatments can be proposed to different patient profiles.
for a better care, the recommendations of the competent authorities point the must on the importance of the generalization and democratization of the care related to the mental disorders, the early detection of the psychoses, the therapeutic education, the adaptation of the treatment and its observance .
Our problem is to propose a solution to help a better management of mental disorders

# SOLUTION

Our solution is to create an application where the doctor and the patient collaborate for a better follow-up and thus a better care.
for his part, the doctor periodically informs his report on the state of health of his patient. The patient, for his part, provides real-time data to his doctor in a passive way, via social networks that contain crucial information about the mental state of an individual, or in an active way by relying on a questionnaire on adverse effects related to his treatment.
With this solution, the psychiatrist can follow his patient in real time and thus offer him a personalized treatment that will be more effective and better tolerated.
our solution can also send an alert to the psychiatrist in case of detection of a critical signal such as suicide, which is a determining factor in the management of psychosis. for example an alcoholic patient to whom antidepressant treatment is recommended, a weaning of two weeks is indicated EXCEPT if it presents a risk of suicide, in this case the doctor can miss the risk of suicide and prescribe a cure of weaning.
